INGREDIENTS:

- 5-6 cups peeled and thinly sliced apples (such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Golden Delicious)
- 100 g cup granulated sugar
- 100 g flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for topping (optional)



PREPARATION:

1- Prepare the pie crust as per the recipe provided earlier. Roll out the pie crust to fit a 9-inch pie dish, and place it in the pie dish. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges.

2- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

3- In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, lemon juice, and vanilla extract for the apple filling. Stir until the apples are evenly coated with the mixture.

4- Pour the apple filling into the prepared pie crust in the pie dish, spreading it evenly.

5- Dot the top of the apple filling with small pieces of unsalted butter.

6- Roll out the second pie crust to fit the top of the pie, and place it over the apple filling. You can create a lattice pattern or simply cover the pie with the crust, sealing the edges by pressing them together with a fork or your fingers. Make a few slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.

7- Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

8- Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool to room temperature.

9- Once the pie is fully cooled, you can optionally top it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream before serving.

10- Serve and enjoy your homemade apple pie with a luscious apple filling and a flaky pie crust!
