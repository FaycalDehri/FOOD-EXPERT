INGREDIENTS:

- 1 Pie crust
- 100 g Pastry cream
- 5-6 cups peeled and sliced peaches (fresh or frozen)
- 100 g granulated sugar
- 100 g flour
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

PREPARATION:

1- Prepare the pie crust as per the recipe provided earlier. Roll out half of the pie crust to fit a 9-inch pie dish, and place it in the pie dish. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges.

2- In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, almond extract (if using), and vanilla extract for the peach filling. Stir until well combined.

3- Pour the pre-made pastry cream into the prepared pie crust in the pie dish.

4- Spoon the peach filling over the pastry cream, spreading it evenly.

5- Roll out the remaining half of the pie crust and place it over the peach filling. Trim, fold, and crimp the edges of the pie crust to seal the pie.

6- Cut a few slits or create a lattice pattern on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.

7- Place the peach pie on a baking sheet to catch any potential spills, and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

8- Remove the peach pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the filling to set.

9- Serve and enjoy your homemade peach pie with a luscious pastry cream filling and a flaky pie crust!
