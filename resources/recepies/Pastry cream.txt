INGREDIENT:

- 500 ml milk
- 100 g granulated sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 50 g cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt


PREPARATIONS:

1- In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and half of the sugar. Heat over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.

2- In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, remaining sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until well combined and smooth.

3- Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.

4- Once all the milk has been added to the egg yolk mixture, pour the mixture back into the saucepan and return to the stovetop over medium heat.

5- Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it thickens and comes to a boil. Continue to cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to ensure the cornstarch is fully cooked.

6- Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any lumps or solids.

7- Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate until chilled, for at least 2 hours or overnight.

8- Once chilled, give the pastry cream a good whisk to smooth out any lumps or air bubbles before using as a filling in your desired dessert.
