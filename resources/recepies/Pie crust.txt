INGREDIENTS:

- 300 g flour
- 100 g butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 6-8 tablespoons ice water


PREPARATIONS:

1- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar until well combined.

2- Add the cold cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.

3- Slowly add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, to the flour mixture. Gently mix with a fork or your fingers after each addition, just until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can result in a tough crust.

4- Once the dough has come together, divide it into two equal portions and shape each portion into a disc. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until firm.

5- When ready to use, remove one disc of dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish, about 12 inches in diameter.

6- Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to your pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides of the dish. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges.

7- At this point, you can either proceed to fill and bake the pie according to your desired recipe, or if using a double crust pie, you can roll out the second disc of dough and place it on top of the filling, sealing the edges with the bottom crust by crimping or pressing with a fork.

8- If pre-baking the crust, you can prick the bottom of the crust with a fork and bake it in a preheated oven at 425°F (220°C) for about 12-15 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. If using a pie filling that requires baking, follow the recipe instructions for baking times and temperatures accordingly.

9- Once the pie is baked, allow it to cool slightly before serving, and enjoy your homemade pie with a delicious crust!
