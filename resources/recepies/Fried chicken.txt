INGREDIENTS:

- 8-10 pieces of chicken (such as drumsticks, thighs, wings, or bone-in breast)
- 200 g flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 100 g butter
- 1 teaspoon Vegetable oil for frying


PREPARATIONS:

1- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using) to make the dry coating mixture.

2- Dip each piece of chicken into the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off.

3- Coat the chicken pieces in the dry coating mixture, pressing the mixture onto the chicken to adhere well. Shake off any excess flour.

4- Place the coated chicken pieces on a baking sheet or wire rack and let them rest for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to set.

5- In a large heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer, heat enough vegetable oil to cover the chicken pieces by about 2 inches to a temperature of 350째F (175째C) over medium-high heat.

6- Carefully lower the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, a few pieces at a time, without overcrowding the pot.

7- Fry the chicken pieces for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are deep golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165째F (74째C).

8- Using tongs or a slotted spoon, carefully remove the fried chicken pieces from the hot oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack to drain any excess oil.

9- Repeat the frying process with the remaining chicken pieces until all are fried.

10- Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the coating to set and the chicken to cool slightly.

11- Serve the fried chicken hot as a delicious and crispy comfort food.
