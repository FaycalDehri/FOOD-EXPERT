INGREDIENTS: 

- Steamed Cauliflower
- 1 Egg
- 100 g Flower
- 100 ml Milk
- 1 ts Baking Powder
- 1 ts Oil  
- Seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika)
- Salt



PREPARATIONS:

1- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour baking powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.

2- Gradually add the milk to the dry ingredients, whisking until a smooth batter is formed. The batter should have a thick but pourable consistency.

3- Add the cauliflower florets to the batter, and toss to coat them evenly.

4- In a deep heavy-bottomed pot or fryer, heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C) over medium-high heat.

5- Using a slotted spoon or tongs, carefully drop the battered cauliflower florets into the hot oil, a few at a time, without overcrowding the pot.

6- Fry the cauliflower florets for about 3-4 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy, turning them occasionally to ensure even frying.

7- Using a slotted spoon or a wire mesh skimmer, remove the fried cauliflower florets from the hot oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

8- Repeat the process with the remaining battered cauliflower florets until all are fried.

9- Serve the deep-fried cauliflower hot with a dipping sauce of your choice.

10- Enjoy the crispy and flavorful deep-fried cauliflower as a tasty snack or appetizer!
