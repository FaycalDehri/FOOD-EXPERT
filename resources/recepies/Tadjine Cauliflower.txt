INGREDIENTS:

- 1 Steamed Cauliflower
- 250 g Grated Cheese 
- 200 ml milk
- 50 g Flour
- 50 g Butter
- Salt & Black Pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

PREPARATION:

1- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a baking dish.

2- Wash the cauliflower head and remove the leaves and tough stem. Cut the cauliflower into small florets.

3- Bring a large pot of water to a boil and blanch the cauliflower florets for about 5 minutes, or until they are slightly tender. Drain the cauliflower and set aside.

4- In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk continuously for 2-3 minutes to make a roux.

5- Slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until a thick sauce is formed. Cook the sauce for another 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly, until it thickens.

6- Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in 1 1/2 cups of grated cheese, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.

7- Place the blanched cauliflower florets in the greased baking dish and pour the cheese sauce over the top, covering the cauliflower evenly.

8- Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of grated cheese over the top of the cauliflower gratin.

9- Bake the gratin in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.

10- Remove the gratin from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

11- Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired, and serve the cauliflower gratin hot as a delicious side dish or main course.
