INGREDIENTS:

- 3 large eggs
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or cooking oil
- Fillings of your choice (e.g. cheese, vegetables, cooked meat, herbs)

PREPARATIONS:

1- In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the eggs together with a pinch of salt and a dash of black pepper until well beaten.

2- Heat a non-stick skillet or omelette pan over medium heat and melt the butter or heat the cooking oil.

3- Pour the beaten eggs into the hot skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a minute or until the edges start to set.

4- Use a spatula to gently lift the cooked edges of the omelette and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow underneath.

5- Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes or until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly soft in the middle.

6- Add your desired fillings (e.g. cheese, vegetables, cooked meat, herbs) to one half of the omelette.

7- Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings using the spatula to help guide the fold.

8- Cook for another minute to melt the cheese and finish cooking the omelette to your desired level of doneness.

9- Slide the omelette onto a serving plate and season with additional salt and black pepper, if desired.

10- Serve the omelette hot with toast, potatoes, or other accompaniments of your choice.
