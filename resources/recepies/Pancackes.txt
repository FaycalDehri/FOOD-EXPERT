INGREDIENTS:

- 250 g flour
- 2 Eggs
- 250 ml Milk
- 100 g Sugar
- 50 g Butter
- 5 g Vanilla
- Salt


PREPARATIONS:

1- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs and vanilla until well combined.

2- Gradually add the milk while whisking, until the batter becomes smooth and free of lumps.

3- Add the salt and melted butter to the batter, and whisk until incorporated.

4- Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat and lightly grease with cooking spray or a little butter.

5- Pour about 1/4 cup of the crepe batter into the hot pan, swirling it around to evenly coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer.

6- Cook the crepe for about 1-2 minutes, until the edges start to lift and the bottom is lightly golden.

7- Flip the crepe using a spatula, and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.

8- Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate, and repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding a little more butter or cooking spray to the pan as needed.

9- Stack the cooked crepes on top of each other, and keep them warm by covering with a clean kitchen towel while you continue to cook the rest of the batter.

10- Once all the crepes are cooked, you can fill them with your favorite sweet or savory fillings, such as Nutella, strawberries, cheese, ham, or eggs.

11- Roll up or fold the crepes, and serve them hot as a delicious breakfast, brunch, or dessert option.
