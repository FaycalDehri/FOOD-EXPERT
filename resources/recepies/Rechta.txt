INGREDIENTS:

- 1 pack rechta
- 1 pound beef or lamb meat, cut into small pieces
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 turnips, peeled and diced
- 1 cup chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 300 ml beef or vegetable broth
- Olive oil, for cooking

PREPARATIONS:

1- In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt for the pasta. Gradually add water while kneading until a smooth and elastic dough is formed. Shape the dough into a ball and cover with a clean towel. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.

2- Meanwhile, in a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until softened and fragrant.

3- Add the meat to the pot and cook until browned on all sides.

4- Add the diced turnip, potatoes, and soaked chickpeas to the pot. Season with salt, black pepper, turmeric, paprika, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, and ground nutmeg. Stir to coat the meat and vegetables with the spices.

5- Stir in the tomato paste and beef or vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.

6- In the meantime, roll out the rested dough on a floured surface to a thin sheet. Cut the dough into long, thin strips.

7- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cut dough strips and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Drain and set aside.

8- Once the meat and vegetables are cooked, add the cooked pasta to the pot and stir gently to combine.

9- Serve the rechta hot in bowls, garnished with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.
