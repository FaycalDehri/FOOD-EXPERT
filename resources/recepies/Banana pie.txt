INGREDIENTS:

- 1 Pie crust
- 100 g Pasty cream
- 3-4 ripe bananas, sliced
- 200 g sugar
- 50 g cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 350 ml whole milk
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Whipped cream, for topping (optional)


PREPARATION:

1- Prepare the pie crust as per the recipe provided earlier. Roll out the pie crust to fit a 9-inch pie dish, and place it in the pie dish. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges.

2- In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt for the banana filling. Gradually whisk in the milk until smooth.

3- Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. Continue to whisk and cook for 1-2 minutes more.

4- In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Gradually whisk in about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture to temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.

5- Slowly pour the tempered egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture, whisking constantly. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the filling thickens to a pudding-like consistency.

6- Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

7- Add the sliced bananas to the prepared pie crust in the pie dish.

8- Pour the hot banana filling over the sliced bananas in the pie crust, spreading it evenly.

9- Allow the pie to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours to allow the filling to set.

10- Once the pie is fully chilled and set, you can optionally top it with whipped cream before serving.

11- Serve and enjoy your homemade banana cream pie with a luscious pastry cream filling and a flaky pie crust!
