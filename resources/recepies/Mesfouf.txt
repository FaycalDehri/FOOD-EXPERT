INGREDIENTS:

- Steamed Couscous
- 100g peas
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
- Stewed vegetables and/or meat of your choice (such as carrots, potatoes, chickpeas, lamb, beef, or chicken)
- Spices of your choice (such as paprika, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, etc.)
- Olive oil for drizzling (optional)


PREPARATIONS:

1- Place the couscous in the top part of the couscous steamer or in a fine-mesh sieve that fits over the pot of boiling water. Steam the couscous for about 15-20 minutes, or until it is fluffy and fully cooked. If using a couscous steamer, make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions.

2- While the couscous is steaming, you can also prepare the stewed vegetables and/or meat. You can sauté them in a separate pan with spices of your choice until they are cooked and tender.

3- Once the couscous is cooked, transfer it to a large serving plate or platter. Fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.

4- Arrange the stewed vegetables and/or meat on top of the couscous.

5- Drizzle with olive oil, if desired, for added flavor and moisture.

6- Serve hot and enjoy your delicious mesfouf!
