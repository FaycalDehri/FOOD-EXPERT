INGREDIENTS:

- 4 large potatoes 
- Vegetable oil 
- Salt to taste


PREPARATIONS:

1- Peel the potatoes and cut them into long, even strips about 1/4 inch thick. You can use a knife or a French fry cutter for this step.

2- Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. This helps to remove excess starch and promotes crispiness.

3- After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.

4- Heat a large pot or deep fryer with enough vegetable oil to cover the fries to a temperature of 325째F (160째C).

5- Carefully add a batch of potatoes to the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the potatoes in batches if needed.

6- Fry the potatoes for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are pale golden brown and slightly soft. Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh skimmer to remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

7- Increase the temperature of the oil to 375째F (190째C).

8- Once the oil reaches the desired temperature, carefully add the partially cooked fries back to the hot oil in batches.

9- Fry the fries for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Again, use a slotted spoon or wire mesh skimmer to remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

10- Season the hot fries with salt to taste immediately after removing them from the oil.

11- Serve the homemade French fries hot as a delicious side dish or snack, and enjoy their crispy texture and irresistible flavor!
